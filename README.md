Thesis on Language-agnostic Dense Passage Retrieval

Using Facebook's DPR, but exchanging the inner BERT models for LaBSE models.

Training done on one final output layer, with significantly reduced training overall execution.

See results in the folder Evaluation Results, on the tests specified in the evaluation notebook.

Added one of the processed data files, for clearity (MLQA_ALL_20k.json)

For data processing, it is mostly on trying to use Haystack's data document stores. See excel file for explanation on MLQA processing.
